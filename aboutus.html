The purpose of the Positive Vibez Movement is to bring about a change in today’s society and how our young people are generally viewed. We hope to inspire people through highlighting positive young persons, which they can in turn use as role models to motivate them to do positive things. Our focus is to influence the path Barbados as a country is going, through motivating  our country’s future, the youth in a positive way. We intend to make an impact by working together with organisations and institutions such as schools, government, churches, etc. Our end goal is to create a secure, inviting space for young people to grow and nurture their talents. As our movement is being lead by young people we believe that our youth will be more open to hearing what we have to say since we will be coming from a more relatable standpoint. We want to make a difference not only with our words but with our actions and we intend to do so in a series of ways. by having motivational speeches and counselling for our youth who are in schools.</p>
